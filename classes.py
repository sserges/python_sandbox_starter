# A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. An object has properties and methods(functions) associated with it. Almost everything in Python is an object

# Create class


class User:
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name, email, age):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.age = age


# Init user object
brad = User('Brad Traversy', 'brad@gmail.com', 37)
