# If/ Else conditions are used to decide to do something based on something being true or false

x = 10
y = 16

# Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) - Used to compare values

# Simple if
if x == y:
    print(f'{x} is equal to {y}')

# If/else
if x > y:
    print(f'{x} is greater than {y}')
else:
    print(f'{x} is less than {y}')

# Logical operators (and, or, not) - Used to combine conditional statements


# Membership Operators (not, not in) - Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object


# Identity Operators (is, is not) - Compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
